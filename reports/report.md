## Executive Summary

This report analyzes Facebook Ads performance for the undergarments campaign, identifying key drivers of ROAS changes and providing actionable creative recommendations.

## Key Insights

### 1. ROAS declined due to recent increase in spend without proportional increase in revenue

**Confidence:** 80%  
**Category:** roas_decline

**Evidence:**
- Recent ROAS is 5.32, a -3.3% change from previous ROAS
- Total spend increased by 9.29% in the last 89 days
- Average ROAS for the date range is 9.63, indicating a recent decline

**Reasoning:** The recent decline in ROAS suggests that the increase in spend is not being matched by a corresponding increase in revenue. This could be due to a variety of factors, including audience saturation or creative fatigue.

**Recommendation:** Review ad creative and targeting to ensure they are still effective, and consider pausing or optimizing underperforming campaigns

---

### 2. Low CTR is contributing to decreased ROAS, particularly in certain campaigns

**Confidence:** 70%  
**Category:** ctr_issues

**Evidence:**
- Average CTR for the date range is 1.31%
- Multiple campaigns have 0.0 CTR, including 'Women-Studio Spo-ts' and 'WOMEN_Cot-on_Classics'
- Campaign 'MEN BOL COLORS DROP' has a CTR of 0.0045%, indicating potential issues with ad relevance or targeting

**Reasoning:** Low CTR can indicate issues with ad creative, targeting, or bidding strategy. Campaigns with extremely low or zero CTR should be reviewed and optimized to improve performance.

**Recommendation:** Review ad creative and targeting for low-CTR campaigns, and consider testing new ad variations or targeting strategies

---

### 3. Audience saturation may be contributing to decreased ROAS, particularly in retargeting campaigns

**Confidence:** 60%  
**Category:** audience_saturation

**Evidence:**
- Multiple retargeting campaigns have high spend and impressions, but low or zero CTR and ROAS
- Campaign 'Men Pr-mium Modal' has a high ROAS, but also a high spend and impression count, indicating potential audience saturation

**Reasoning:** Retargeting campaigns often have smaller audiences and may be more prone to saturation. High spend and impression counts without corresponding revenue increases can indicate that the audience is being over-targeted.

**Recommendation:** Consider expanding targeting to new audiences, such as lookalike audiences, or rotating ad creative to reduce fatigue
