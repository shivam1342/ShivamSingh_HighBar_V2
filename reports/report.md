## Executive Summary

This report analyzes Facebook Ads performance for the undergarments campaign, identifying key drivers of ROAS changes and providing actionable creative recommendations.

## Key Insights

### 1. ROAS decline is driven by underperforming campaigns with low or zero CVR, indicating potential creative fatigue or audience issues

**Confidence:** 80%  
**Category:** roas_decline

**Evidence:**
- Multiple campaigns (e.g., 'Women | tudio Sports', 'Women | Studi Sports') have 0% CVR despite significant spend and impressions
- Campaigns with low CVR (e.g., 'MEN SIGNATURE SOT', 'women su-mer invisible') have low ROAS, suggesting a correlation between CVR and ROAS
- High spend campaigns (e.g., 'WOMEN Coton Classics', 'Men-Bold Colors Drop') with low CVR may be causing overall ROAS decline

**Reasoning:** The data suggests that campaigns with low or zero CVR are contributing to the overall ROAS decline. This could be due to creative fatigue, where ad creative is no longer resonating with the target audience, or audience issues, where the target audience is not converting as expected.

**Recommendation:** Refresh ad creative, test new targeting options, and consider audience expansion to improve CVR and ROAS

### 2. CTR issues are contributing to underperformance in certain campaigns, potentially due to ad fatigue or targeting issues

**Confidence:** 70%  
**Category:** ctr_issues

**Evidence:**
- Campaigns with 0% CTR (e.g., 'Women-Studio Spo-ts', 'WOMEN_Cot-on_Classics') have low or zero ROAS
- Campaigns with low CTR (e.g., 'MEN BOL COLORS DROP', 'women Summer Inv-sible') have low ROAS, suggesting a correlation between CTR and ROAS

**Reasoning:** The data suggests that campaigns with low or zero CTR are contributing to underperformance. This could be due to ad fatigue, where the target audience is no longer engaging with the ads, or targeting issues, where the target audience is not being reached effectively.

**Recommendation:** Test new ad creative, targeting options, and consider audience expansion to improve CTR and ROAS

### 3. Audience saturation may be contributing to underperformance in retargeting campaigns, potentially due to over-targeting the same audience

**Confidence:** 60%  
**Category:** audience_saturation

**Evidence:**
- Retargeting campaigns (e.g., 'Men Pr-mium Modal', 'Men Premiu- Modal') have low or zero CTR and CVR
- High spend retargeting campaigns (e.g., 'Men-Bold Colors Drop') have low ROAS, suggesting potential audience saturation

**Reasoning:** The data suggests that retargeting campaigns may be experiencing audience saturation, where the target audience is being over-targeted, leading to decreased engagement and conversions.

**Recommendation:** Consider expanding targeting options, refreshing ad creative, or adjusting retargeting strategies to reduce audience saturation
