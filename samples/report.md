**Query:** Why is ROAS declining?

---

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes Facebook Ads performance for the undergarments campaign, identifying key drivers of ROAS changes and providing actionable creative recommendations.

## Key Insights

### 1. ROAS decline is driven by underperforming adsets with low or zero revenue

**Confidence:** 80%  
**Category:** roas_decline

**Evidence:**
- Top underperformers have zero revenue despite significant spend (e.g., 'm n | athleisure cooling' adset spent $142.11 with 0 revenue)
- Multiple adsets have zero ROAS, indicating a potential issue with ad targeting or creative assets
- Adsets with low CTR (e.g., 'women Summer Inv-sible' adset with 0.0116% CTR) also tend to have low or zero revenue

**Reasoning:** The presence of multiple adsets with zero revenue suggests that the targeting or ad creative may not be resonating with the audience, leading to a decline in overall ROAS

**Recommendation:** Pause or re-optimize underperforming adsets, and consider refreshing ad creative to improve targeting and engagement

---

### 2. Creative fatigue may be contributing to the ROAS decline, particularly for Video ad creative

**Confidence:** 70%  
**Category:** creative_fatigue

**Evidence:**
- Video ad creative has the lowest ROAS (5.35) among all creative types
- Video ad creative has a lower CTR (0.0118%) compared to other creative types (e.g., Image: 0.0131%, UGC: 0.0134%)
- The fact that Video ad spend is the highest ($753,236.78) while having the lowest ROAS suggests potential creative fatigue

**Reasoning:** The lower ROAS and CTR for Video ad creative, combined with its high spend, suggests that the audience may be experiencing creative fatigue, leading to decreased engagement and revenue

**Recommendation:** Refresh Video ad creative assets, and consider allocating more budget to higher-performing creative types (e.g., Image, UGC)

---

### 3. Audience saturation may be contributing to the ROAS decline, particularly for Retargeting adsets

**Confidence:** 60%  
**Category:** audience_saturation

**Evidence:**
- Retargeting adsets have low or zero revenue despite significant spend (e.g., 'MEN SIGNATURE SOT' adset spent $375.57 with 0 revenue)
- Retargeting adsets tend to have lower CTR (e.g., 'm n | athleisure cooling' adset with 0% CTR) and lower ROAS
- The fact that Retargeting adsets are targeting a smaller audience may lead to faster saturation and decreased effectiveness

**Reasoning:** The presence of multiple Retargeting adsets with low or zero revenue suggests that the audience may be experiencing saturation, leading to decreased engagement and revenue

**Recommendation:** Consider expanding targeting to new audiences (e.g., LAL) or refreshing ad creative to improve engagement and reduce saturation
